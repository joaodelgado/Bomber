BomberWar
=========

My attempt to make a game in python, using [pygame modules](http://pygame.org).
The game is heavily inspired by the awesome free game [Bomberjam](http://iamclaw.com/?page_id=235).

BomberWar is a two player game where each player has to conquer territory, by placing bombs, until the opponent is trapped.

Commands:

    Player 1:
        WASD to move
        Space to place a bomb

    Player 2:
        Arrow keys to move
        P to place a bomb

To run just run:

    python bomberwar.py

*[Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](http://pygame.org) are required.
