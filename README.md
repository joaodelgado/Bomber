#Bomber


My attempt to make a game in python, using [pygame modules](http://pygame.org).
The game is heavily inspired by the awesome free game [Bomberjam](http://iamclaw.com/?page_id=235).


Bomber is a two player game where each player has to conquer territory, by placing bombs, until the opponent is trapped.
Various powerups can appear when conquering territory, wich can enhance your bombs, speed and bomb capacity.

#####Commands

    
    Player 1:
        WASD to move
        Space to place a bomb

    Player 2:
        Arrow keys to move
        P to place a bomb

To play just run:

    python bomber.py

[Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/) and [Pygame](http://pygame.org) are required.
